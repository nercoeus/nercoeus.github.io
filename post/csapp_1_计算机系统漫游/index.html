<h3 id="compilation-system-contains-4-parts-as-follows">compilation system (contains 4 parts as follows)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Preprocessing phase: modifies the original C program, list exchange include code.</li>
<li>Compilation phase: translate text file to assembly-language program. Assembly-language is useful because it provides a common output language for different compilers for different high-level languages.</li>
<li>Assembly phase: translate assemly-language to machine-language instruction, packages them in a from known as a relocatable object program, and store in the object file <em><strong>hello.o</strong></em></li>
<li>Linking phase: hello program use standard C library(printf.o). The linker merge <em><strong>hello.o</strong></em> and <em><strong>printf.o</strong></em> and create the <em><strong>hello</strong></em> file, which is an executable object file.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="some-reasons-why-programmers-need-to-understand-how-compliation-systems-word">some reasons why programmers need to understand how compliation systems word</h3>
<ul>
<li>Optimizing program performance: in order to make good coding decisions in programs, we do need a basic understanding of machine-level code and how the compiler translates different C statements into machine code. [chapter 3, 6]</li>
<li>Understanding link-time errors: For example: what does it mean when the linker reports hat it cannot resolve a reference? What id the difference between a static library and a dynamic library? [chapter 7]</li>
<li>Avoiding security holes: Too few programmers understand the need to carefully restrict the quantity and forms of data they accept from untrustes sources. [chapter 3]</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="hardware-orgnization-of-a-system">Hardware orgnization of a system</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Buses</strong>: Running throughout the system is a collection of electrical conduits called buses that carry bytes of information back and forth between the components.</li>
<li><strong>I/O devices</strong>: I/O devices are the system`s connection to the external world. For example keyboard, mouse and disk drive.</li>
<li><strong>Main memory</strong>: The main memory is a temporary storage device that holds both a program and the data it manipulates while processor is excuting the program.</li>
<li><strong>Processor</strong>: The central processing uint(CPU), or simply processor, is the engine that interprets (or executes) instructions stored in main memory.</li>
</ul>
<p> 
⭐️application programmers who are aware of cache memories can exploit them to improve the performance of their programs by an order of magnitude.</p>
<h3 id="the-operating-system-has-two-primary-purposes"><strong>The operating system has two primary purposes:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>to protect the hardware from misuse by runaway applications.</li>
<li>to provide applications with simple and uniform mechanisms for manipulating complicated and often wildly different low-level hardware devices.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-operating-system-achieves-both-goals-via-the-fundamental-abstractions-shown-in-figure-111-processes-virtual-memory-and-files">The operating system achieves both goals via the fundamental abstractions shown in Figure 1.11: processes, virtual memory, and files.</h3>
<p><img src="/images/csapp/1-11.jpg" alt=""></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Processes</strong>: A process is the operating system’s abstraction for a running program.</li>
<li><strong>Threads</strong>: Although we normally think of a process as having a single control flow, in modern systems a process can actually consist of multiple execution units, called threads, each running in the context of the process and sharing the same code and global data.</li>
<li><strong>Files</strong>: A file is a sequence of bytes, nothing more and nothing less. Every I/O device, including disks, keyboards, displays, and even networks, is modeled as a file. All input and output in the system is performed by reading and writing files, using a small set of system calls known as Unix I/O.</li>
<li><strong>Virtual</strong> Memory: Virtual memory is an abstraction that provides each process with the illusion that it has exclusive use of the main memory.
<img src="/images/csapp/1-13.jpg" alt=""></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="concurrency-and-parallelism">Concurrency and Parallelism</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Processes Concurrency</strong>: All programs can be processed simultaneously by switching between threads or processes on one CPU core.</li>
<li><strong>Processes Parallelism</strong>: Multiple CPU cores executing different processes or threads at the same time</li>
<li><strong>Instruction-Level Parallelism</strong>: At a much lower level of abstraction, modern processors can execute multiple instructions at one time.</li>
<li><strong>Single-Instruction, Multiple-Data (SIMD) Parallelism</strong>: At the lowest level, many modern processors have special hardware that allows a single instruction to cause multiple operations to be performed in parallel.</li>
</ul>
